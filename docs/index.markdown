# Introduction

Hi. This is a website documenting my personal set-up with respect to:

* **ricing:** making my laptop pretty
* **software:** various software I use & configs (& modifications)
* **self-hosting:** server-based web apps

The navigation bar on the right should contain all the pages, and the button in the header will lead you to the GitHub repo that holds various resources such as icons and scripts, as well as the source code for this website.
