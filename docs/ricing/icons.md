# Icons

I use the [Shadow-Dark](https://github.com/L4ki/Shadows-Plasma-Themes) icons for my folders. I mostly use [candy](https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons) icons for everything else, with [BeautyLine](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1425426) for the ones that candy doesn't have. For the apps that doesn't seem to have a colourful-gradient-outline icon, I made some myself, which can be accessed from the [repo](https://github.com/acertaingrace/acertaingrace.github.io/tree/main/ricing/icons).
