# External Sites

A short summary of external site skins:

* **AO3:** Mix of a Wonderland theme by anneown (deleted by creator), [Tide by ElectricAlice](https://github.com/electricalice/Ao3-tide), my own customisations, hide hit counts, and block works. I'm am eagerly waiting for [Hesperus by PinkAxolotl85](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1130jku/6_months_on_from_the_first_hesperus_peak/).
* **YouTube:** Stylus browser extension with [Hello Kitty theme by YAD](https://uso.kkx.one/style/244526)
* **Tumblr:** Goth Rave for dashboard ; [Lilac theme by Seyche](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/41141) for Tumblr blog
* **Canvas:** Stylist browser extension; the dashboard cards were too big so I adjusted it so it can fit 4 cards on one line
