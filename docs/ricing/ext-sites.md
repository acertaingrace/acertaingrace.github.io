# External Sites

A short summary of external site skins:

* **AO3:** I used to use a mix of an Alice in Wonderland theme by anneown (deleted by creator), [Tide by ElectricAlice](https://github.com/electricalice/Ao3-tide), my own customisations, hide hit counts, and block works. I am now using [Hesperus by PinkAxolotl85](https://www.tumblr.com/angel-axo/780148343337893888/hello-i-apologize-if-this-is-a-presumptuous?source=share) ([preview](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1130jku/6_months_on_from_the_first_hesperus_peak/)).
* **YouTube:** Stylus browser extension with [Hello Kitty theme by YAD](https://uso.kkx.one/style/244526)
* **Tumblr:** Goth Rave for dashboard ; [Lilac theme by Seyche](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/41141) for Tumblr blog
* **Canvas:** Stylist browser extension; the dashboard cards were too big so I adjusted it so it can fit 4 cards on one line
