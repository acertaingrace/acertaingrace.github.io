# GNOME Extensions

## Dash to Dock

I first used Linux on Ubuntu and I liked that option.

## Workspace Indicator

I technically have four (one built-in GNOME). I customised one to use Chữ Nôm.

## Blur my Shell

I did blur everything before, but it was slightly distracting, so only Foxit Reader, Praat, and Spotify have this enabled (as well as the dock).

## Walkpaper

I had to port this to GNOME 46.
