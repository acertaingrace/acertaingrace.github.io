# Shimejis

I'm using [@qualitanty/slugcat-shimeji-linux](https://github.com/qualitanty/slugcat-shimeji-linux), for reasons unknown. I can't remember why I didn't use the original repo; I think it was because of [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/16os0ay/comment/k33spzg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)? I don't think the Spamton AUR package referenced in that post worked for me.

The shimejis I use currently include:

* Homura Akemi ([reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadokaMagica/comments/n4zys0/madoka_magica_desktop_shimeji_companions_redux/) \| [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ti46fe5lcsa3f8yy31zbx/AKyXVu_w2obvxYNNTUthPCA?rlkey=vnejcjuhsrt8cmswlvhyf0yrb&e=1&dl=0))
* Wangxian ([creator twitter post](https://x.com/1008love18/status/1195414376171229185) \| [drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lM8FJsl9Qeo6Es9w5w1YJeHBgloZMAiz/view))

* slugcat too ig (I have no idea who this creature is)

I had to fix something for it to work on linux, but I can't remember whatâ€¦ There was definitely something about X11 and Wayland. And missing photos. I'm looking through the git diffs and I have no idea what is happening. Pretty sure that Reddit comment helped.
