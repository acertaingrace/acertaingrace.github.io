# Icons

These are modified icons using a gradient outline look (Ã  la [@EliverLara's candy-icons](https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons)). 

The Praat and Antconc logos were created by tracing over the original logos in Inkscape.

The Tailscale logo was modified from [Donnnno (at SVG Repo)](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/519608/tailscale).

The Dasherr logo was modified from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/server?f=classic&s=solid).
